Statistical application spans across sectors. So does research software.

Are you a department that is looking to adopt a license and cost-free solution that is Gxp compliant for statistical analysis and data science outputs ?

Do you have a skill and technological transformation in R, Version Control and good engineering practices ?

R packages are the core of the R programming language. Many established packages or software already exist. It is absolutely valid to create tailored infrastructure out of existing ways of working, whether it's for standardization and or efficiency gains. Version control can simplify complex projects that bring the brightest minds to collaborate.
